  <h2>International Conference on Trends in Optics and Photonics (IConTOP) - 2023</h2>
  <p>IConTOP is a flagship Conference of the Department of Applied Optics and Photonics, University of Calcutta, previously organized in 2009 and 2011. The present edition of this Conference, IConTOP-2023, is being organized to commemorate the Birth Centenary of Prof. Manoranjan De, who had laid the foundations of this Department as early as mid 1950s.</p>
  <p>Like the previous editions of this Conference, IConTOP-2023 will provide a platform to bring together academicians, scientists, engineers, and researchers to share the fruits of their journey through the domain of Optics and Photonics. The Conference will help budding researchers as well as hardcore professionals to put into perspective the rapid pace of development and emerging technologies, through invited and contributory presentations, informal exchanges, and industrial exhibits.</p>
  <p>IConTOP 2023 is also a humble effort by the Department of Applied Optics and Photonics to pay homage to its founding father and visionary Prof. Manoranjan De. To commemorate his birth centenary, Journal of Optics (the Journal of the Optical Society of India, co-published by Springer India) has also planned a Special Issue in 2024. Paper submissions to this Topical Conference are eligible to be published in this Special Issue of the Journal subject to the consent of the author and favorable review.</p>

  <img class="about-image" src="Prof.png" alt="Professor Manoranjan De">
  <p>Prof. Manoranjan De (1923-2011) widely recognized as the
    pioneer of applied optics education in India, completed his Masters in Applied Physics from University of Calcutta
    in the late forties of the last century. After a brief stint as an electrical engineer at A.E.I., he joined the faculty of
    Applied Physics in early 1950s. Thereafter he obtained D.I.C. and Ph.D. under Late Harold H. Hopkins from the
    Imperial College, London. On his return to India in the mid-fifties he initiated teaching of Applied Optics at the
    University of Calcutta. Prof. De nurtured this course that was continually modified, keeping in tune with the
    burgeoning developments in the field, till his retirement from the university in 1983. During 1953–1983 he had held
    visiting assignments in several renowned research centers of applied optics in different parts of the world, including
    Laval University, Quebec, Canada, IBM Research Laboratory, USA, CSIRO, Australia, and Reading University,
    U.K. Prof. De had extensive collaborations with scientists of National Physical Laboratory, Delhi and the optics
    faculty of Physics Department of IIT Delhi. He used to have close liaison with the founding fathers of the
    International Commission for Optics, notably H. H. Hopkins, A. W. Lohmann, A. Maréchal, M. Francon, W. Steel
    and A. Boivin among others. He had been in the Editorial Board of Optica Acta from its inception and had close
    liaison with his peers in India and abroad. Prof De was the founder member of the Optical Society of India and the
    founder editor of the Journal of Optics.
    Prof. De extensively worked in theory of image formation, image evaluation techniques, optical design, holography,
    theory of interference and interferometry, diffraction and polarization, Fourier and Fresnel Optics, thin films,
    optical fabrication and testing and other related topics. He was also actively involved in the promotion of optics
    industry in India. He was instrumental in establishing the company, M/s Precision Optics Manufacturing Company
    (POM), which earned distinction in supplying custom built precision optical components and systems. Also, Prof.
    De extended consultancy services in optical engineering to many companies and research establishments.</p>
